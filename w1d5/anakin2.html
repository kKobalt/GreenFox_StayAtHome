            Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. <time>32 BBY</time> Boonta Eve
            Classic Race Champion
          </h4>
          <p>
            In my spare time at Wald’s Parts junk shop I designed and built a
            Class III open cockpit Podracer capable of 588 mph top speed. Went on
            to win the Boonta Eve Classic race in <time>32 BBY</time> - first ever win by a
            human. Generated documented company revenue of over 59 wupiupi during
            the course of my enslavement.

            Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects
          </h4>
          <p>
            During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge
            of large capital construction projects for the Deep Space Fleet.
            Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by
            annihilating Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in the Core Worlds
            region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire power of the imperial
            fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing both
            projects to run-away photon torpedoes.
